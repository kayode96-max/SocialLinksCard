## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Structuring HTML for accessibility and semantics
- Using CSS custom properties for easy theming
- Responsive design using Flexbox
- Creating interactive states for buttons and links

Example of a custom property:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
}
```

Example of a semantic HTML structure:

```html
<main class="profile-card">
  <img src="assets/images/avatar.png" alt="Profile avatar">
  <h1>Jessica Randall</h1>
  <p>London, United Kingdom</p>
  <p>"Front-end developer and avid reader."</p>
  <ul class="social-links">
    <li><a href="#">GitHub</a></li>
    <!-- ... -->
  </ul>
</main>
```

### Continued Development

- Further practice with CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Improving accessibility for keyboard navigation
- Experimenting with CSS animations for interactive elements
